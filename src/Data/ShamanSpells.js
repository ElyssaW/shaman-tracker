It creates a magical barrier around the subject at a distance of 1 foot. The barrier moves with the subject and has three major effects.  First, the subject gains a +2 deflection bonus to AC and a +2 resistance bonus on saves. Both these bonuses apply against attacks made or effects created by evil creatures.  Second, the subject immediately receives another saving throw (if one was allowed to begin with) against any spells or effects that possess or exercise mental control over the creature (including enchantment [charm] effects and enchantment [compulsion] effects such as charm person, command, and dominate person). This saving throw is made with a +2 morale bonus, using the same DC as the original effect.  If successful, such effects are suppressed for the duration of this spell. The effects resume when the duration of this spell expires.  While under the effects of this spell, the target is immune to any new attempts to possess or exercise mental control over the target.  This spell does not expel a controlling life force (such as a ghost or spellcaster using magic jar), but it does prevent them from controlling the target. This second effect only functions against spells and effects created by evil creatures or objects, subject to GM discretion.  Third, the spell prevents bodily contact by evil summoned creatures. This causes the natural weapon attacks of such creatures to fail and the creatures to recoil if such attacks require touching the warded creature. Summoned creatures that are not evil are immune to this effect. The protection against contact by summoned creatures ends if the warded creature makes an attack against or tries to force the barrier against the blocked creature. Spell resistance can allow a creature to overcome this protection and touch the warded creature.","source":"PFRPG Core","verbal":1,"somatic":1,"material":1,"divinefocus":1,"adept":1,"slalevel":1,"domain":"Good (1), Purity (1)","shortdescription":"+2 to AC and saves, plus additional protection against selected alignment.","linktext":"Protection from Evil","id":413,"patron":"Boundaries (2)","mythictext":"The bonuses to AC and on saves increase to +4.

The weapon takes the shape of a weapon favored by your deity or a weapon with some spiritual significance or symbolism to you (see below) and has the same threat range and critical multipliers as a real weapon of its form. It strikes the opponent you designate, starting with one attack in the round the spell is cast and continuing each round thereafter on your turn. It uses your base attack bonus (possibly allowing it multiple attacks per round in subsequent rounds) plus your Wisdom modifier as its attack bonus. It strikes as a spell, not as a weapon, so for example, it can damage creatures that have damage reduction. As a force effect, it can strike incorporeal creatures without the reduction in damage associated with incorporeality. The weapon always strikes from your direction. It does not get a flanking bonus or help a combatant get one. Your feats or combat actions do not affect the weapon. If the weapon goes beyond the spell range, if it goes out of your sight, or if you are not directing it, the weapon returns to you and hovers.  Each round after the first, you can use a move action to redirect the weapon to a new target. If you do not, the weapon continues to attack the previous round's target. On any round that the weapon switches targets, it gets one attack. Subsequent rounds of attacking that target allow the weapon to make multiple attacks if your base attack bonus would allow it to. Even if the spiritual weapon is a ranged weapon, use the spell's range, not the weapon's normal range increment, and switching targets still is a move action.  A spiritual weapon cannot be attacked or harmed by physical attacks, but dispel magic, disintegrate, a sphere of annihilation, or a rod of cancellation affects it. A spiritual weapon's AC against touch attacks is 12 (10 + size bonus for Tiny object).  If an attacked creature has spell resistance, you make a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against that spell resistance the first time the spiritual weapon strikes it. If the weapon is successfully resisted, the spell is dispelled. If not, the weapon has its normal full effect on that creature for the duration of the spell.  The weapon that you get is often a force replica of your deity's own personal weapon. A cleric without a deity gets a weapon based on his alignment. A neutral cleric without a deity can create a spiritual weapon of any alignment, provided he is acting at least generally in accord with that alignment at the time. The weapons associated with each alignment are as follows: chaos (battleaxe), evil (light flail), good (warhammer), law (longsword).","source":"PFRPG Core","verbal":1,"somatic":1,"divinefocus":1,"slalevel":2,"domain":"War (2)","shortdescription":"Â Magic weapon attacks on its own.","linktext":"Spiritual Weapon","id":513,"mythictext":"The weapon gains your choice of one of the following magic weapon special abilities: flaming, frost, keen, merciful, shock, or thundering.

The shards deal an amount of slashing and piercing damage equal to 1d4 points + 1 point per shard beyond the first, and have a threat range of 19-20. They are considered magic weapons for the purpose of bypassing damage reduction. Additionally, if your shield is made from a special material (such as adamantine), the shards penetrate damage reduction and hardness as if they were weapons made from the same material.  At the end of this spell's duration, the shards reform into their original shield form. You regain its shield bonus to AC, provided you still have a free hand in which to wield it. Otherwise, the shield falls at your feet in your square.","source":"Armor Masters Handbook","verbal":1,"somatic":1,"slalevel":2,"id":2410,"lvlId":69},{"classes":{"cleric":2,"paladin":2,"inquisitor":2,"oracle":2,"antipaladin":2,"shaman":2,"spiritualist":2},"effects":{"force":1},"name":"Spiritual Squire","school":"evocation","descriptor":"force","spelllevel":"antipaladin 2, cleric/oracle 2, inquisitor 2, paladin 2, shaman 2, spiritualist 2","castingtime":"1 standard action","components":"V, S, DF","range":"medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)","duration":"1 minute/level (D)","dismissible":1,"savingthrow":"none","spellresistance":"no","description":"This spell causes an ally made of pure force to appear in a single 5-foot square within range.

This spell can't contact creatures with more than 6 Hit Dice. You can't send a specific message, but this spell (and all similar contact entity spells) can be characterized as an open invitation to make contact and establish communication. If there is an appropriate entity within range, the spell succeeds automatically. You don't know whether the message was received, nor any specific details about what creatures received it or how many. Creatures that receive the message know the location and distance from where the spell was cast. Because this spell doesn't  call or summon the target, the target must have its own way to reach the place where the spell was cast.  How creatures respond to a contact spell is circumstantial and it is possible the creatures will simply ignore the spell. Creatures that come and investigate do so in their own time. They usually arrive cautiously, aware of the potential for ambush. Targets of the spell might inform their organization or community if they have one. There are no restrictions on how the creatures react to being contacted, and they might respond with hostility, parley, entertain an alliance, or subjugate the caster and their related community. Using this spell counts as mentally contacting the creature for the purpose of any of its special abilities (such as the star-spawn's overwhelming mind). For the purpose of spells like scrying, the creature has firsthand knowledge of you and a connection similar to if it possessed a likeness of you.  Each type of creature requires a different material component that must be included when casting the spell, as shown on Table 4-1: Contact Entity on page 112. Some of these components are expensive or might require quests to acquire. Contacting certain types of creatures makes the spell chaotic, evil, or both, as indicated on the table.","source":"Horror Adventures","verbal":1,"somatic":1,"material":1,"slalevel":2,"shortdescription":" Ask eldritch entities to find and converse with you.","id":2502,"lvlId":74},{"classes":{"sor":2,"wiz":2,"cleric":2,"druid":2,"witch":2,"oracle":2,"shaman":2,"hunter":2},"effects":{"curse":1,"evil":1},"name":"Curse Terrain, Lesser","school":"necromancy","descriptor":"curseUM, evil","spelllevel":"cleric/oracle 2, druid 2, shaman 2, sorcerer/wizard 2, witch 2","castingtime":"10 minutes","components":"V, S, M (the heart of a creature that dwelled in the area and powdered onyx worth 350 gp)","costlycomponents":1,"range":"touch","area":"300-ft. radius emanating from the touched point","duration":"1 day (D)","dismissible":1,"savingthrow":"none","spellresistance":"no","description":"By touching the ground, you curse the land with three unnatural hazards, as the minor perilous demesne curse (see page 145).

A dispelled spell ends as if its duration had expired. Some spells, as detailed in their descriptions, can't be defeated by dispel magic. Dispel magic can dispel (but not counter) spell-like effects just as it does spells. The of a spell with an instantaneous duration can't be dispelled, because the magical effect is already over before the dispel magic can take effect. You choose to use dispel magic in one of two ways: a targeted dispel or a counterspell. Targeted Dispel: One object, creature, or spell is the target of the dispel magic spell. You make one dispel check (1d20 + your caster level) and compare that to the spell with highest caster level (DC = 11 + the spell's caster level). If successful, that spell ends. If not, compare the same result to the spell with the next highest caster level. Repeat this process until you have dispelled one spell affecting the target, or you have failed to dispel every spell. For example, a 7th-level caster casts dispel magic, targeting a creature affected by stoneskin (caster level 12th) and fly (caster level 6th). The caster level check results in a 19. This check is not high enough to end the stoneskin (which would have required a 23 or higher), but it is high enough to end the fly (which only required a 17). Had the dispel check resulted in a 23 or higher, the stoneskin would have been dispelled, leaving the fly intact. Had the dispel check been a 16 or less, no spells would have been affected. You can also use a targeted dispel to specifically end one spell affecting the target or one spell affecting an area (such as a wall of fire). You must name the specific spell effect to be targeted in this way. If your caster level check is equal to or higher than the DC of that spell, it ends. No other spells or effects on the target are dispelled if your check is not high enough to end the targeted effect. If you target an object or creature that is the effect of an ongoing spell (such as a monster summoned by summon monster), you make a dispel check to end the spell that conjured the object or creature. If the object that you target is a magic item, you make a dispel check against the item's caster level (DC = 11 + the item's caster level). If you succeed, all the item's magical properties are suppressed for 1d4 rounds, after which the item recovers its magical properties. A suppressed item becomes nonmagical for the duration of the effect. An interdimensional opening (such as a bag of holding) is temporarily closed. A magic item's physical properties are unchanged: A suppressed magic sword is still a sword (a masterwork sword, in fact). Artifacts and deities are unaffected by mortal magic such as this. You automatically succeed on your dispel check against any spell that you cast yourself. Counterspell: When dispel magic is used in this way, the spell targets a spellcaster and is cast as a counterspell. Unlike a true counterspell, however, dispel magic may not work; you must make a dispel check to counter the other spellcaster's spell.","source":"PFRPG Core","verbal":1,"somatic":1,"slalevel":3,"domain":"Magic (3), Entropy (3)","shortdescription":"Cancels one magical spell or effect.","linktext":"Dispel Magic","id":158,"bloodline":"Arcane (7)","mythictext":"When used as a targeted dispel, this spell can end two spells affecting the target instead of just one.

If a creature too large to fit into the spell's area is the subject of the spell, the spell acts as a normal protection from evil spell for that creature only.  A magic circle leaves much to be desired as a trap. If the circle of powdered silver laid down in the process of spellcasting is broken, the effect immediately ends. The trapped creature can do nothing that disturbs the circle, directly or indirectly, but other creatures can. If the called creature has spell resistance, it can test the trap once a day. If you fail to overcome its spell resistance, the creature breaks free, destroying the circle.  A creature capable of any form of dimensional travel (astral projection, blink, dimension door, etherealness, gate, plane shift, shadow walk, teleport, and similar abilities) can simply leave the circle through such means. You can prevent the creature's extradimensional escape by casting a dimensional anchor spell on it, but you must cast the spell before the creature acts. If you are successful, the anchor effect lasts as long as the magic circle does. The creature cannot reach across the magic circle, but its ranged attacks (ranged weapons, spells, magical abilities, and the like) can. The creature can attack any target it can reach with its ranged attacks except for the circle itself.  You can add a special diagram (a two-dimensional bounded figure with no gaps along its circumference, augmented with various magical sigils) to make the magic circle more secure. Drawing the diagram by hand takes 10 minutes and requires a DC 20 Spellcraft check. You do not know the result of this check. If the check fails, the diagram is ineffective. You can take 10 when drawing the diagram if you are under no particular time pressure to complete the task.  This task also takes 10 full minutes. If time is no factor at all, and you devote 3 hours and 20 minutes to the task, you can take 20.  A successful diagram allows you to cast a dimensional anchor spell on the magic circle during the round before casting any summoning spell. The anchor holds any called creatures in the magic circle for 24 hours per caster level. A creature cannot use its spell resistance against a magic circle prepared with a diagram, and none of its abilities or attacks can cross the diagram. If the creature tries a Charisma check to break free of the trap (see the lesser planar binding spell), the DC increases by 5. The creature is immediately released if anything disturbs the diagram-even a straw laid across it. The creature itself cannot disturb the diagram either directly or indirectly, as noted above.  This spell is not cumulative with protection from evil and vice versa.","source":"PFRPG Core","verbal":1,"somatic":1,"material":1,"divinefocus":1,"slalevel":3,"domain":"Good (3)","shortdescription":"As protection spells, but 10-ft. radius and 10 min./level.","linktext":"Magic Circle against Evil","id":328,"bloodline":"Celestial (7)","patron":"Boundaries (6)","lvlId":14},{"classes":{"sor":3,"wiz":3,"cleric":3,"paladin":3,"summoner":3,"inquisitor":3,"oracle":3,"shaman":3,"medium":3,"occultist":3,"spiritualist":3,"summonerunchained":3},"effects":{"lawful":1},"name":"Magic Circle against Chaos","school":"abjuration","descriptor":"lawful","spelllevel":"cleric/oracle 3, paladin 3, sorcerer/wizard 3, summoner/unchained summoner 3, inquisitor 3, shaman 3, occultist 3, spiritualist 3, medium 3","castingtime":"1 standard action","components":"V, S, M/DF (a 3-ft.-diameter circle of powdered silver)","range":"touch","area":"10-ft.-radius emanation from touched creature","duration":"10 min./level","savingthrow":"Will negates (harmless)","spellresistance":"no; see text","description":"This spell functions like magic circle against evil, except that it is similar to protection from chaos instead of protection from evil, and it can imprison a nonlawful called creature.","source":"PFRPG Core","verbal":1,"somatic":1,"material":1,"divinefocus":1,"slalevel":3,"domain":"Law (3)","shortdescription":"As protection spells, but 10-ft. radius and 10 min./level.","linktext":"Magic Circle against Chaos","id":329,"lvlId":15},{"classes":{"sor":3,"wiz":3,"cleric":3,"summoner":3,"inquisitor":3,"oracle":3,"antipaladin":3,"shaman":3,"medium":3,"occultist":3,"spiritualist":3,"summonerunchained":3},"effects":{"evil":1},"name":"Magic Circle against Good","school":"abjuration","descriptor":"evil","spelllevel":"cleric/oracle 3, sorcerer/wizard 3, summoner/unchained summoner 3, inquisitor 3, antipaladin 3, shaman 3, occultist 3, spiritualist 3, medium 3","castingtime":"1 standard action","components":"V, S, M/DF (a 3-ft.-diameter circle of powdered silver)","range":"touch","area":"10-ft.-radius emanation from touched creature","duration":"10 min./level","savingthrow":"Will negates (harmless)","spellresistance":"no; see text","description":"This spell functions like magic circle against evil, except that it is similar to protection from good instead of protection from evil, and it can imprison a nonevil called creature.","source":"PFRPG Core","verbal":1,"somatic":1,"material":1,"divinefocus":1,"slalevel":3,"domain":"Evil (3)","shortdescription":"As protection spells, but 10-ft. radius and 10 min./level.","linktext":"Magic Circle against Good","id":330,"lvlId":16},{"classes":{"sor":3,"wiz":3,"cleric":3,"summoner":3,"inquisitor":3,"oracle":3,"antipaladin":3,"shaman":3,"medium":3,"occultist":3,"spiritualist":3,"summonerunchained":3},"effects":{},"name":"Magic Circle against Law","school":"abjuration","descriptor":"chaotic","spelllevel":"cleric/oracle 3, sorcerer/wizard 3, summoner/unchained summoner 3, inquisitor 3, antipaladin 3, shaman 3, occultist 3, spiritualist 3, medium 3","castingtime":"1 standard action","components":"V, S, M/DF (a 3-ft.-diameter circle of powdered silver)","range":"touch","area":"10-ft.-radius emanation from touched creature","duration":"10 min./level","savingthrow":"Will negates (harmless)","spellresistance":"no; see text","description":"This spell functions like magic circle against evil, except that it is similar to protection from law instead of protection from evil, and it can imprison a nonchaotic called creature.","source":"PFRPG Core","verbal":1,"somatic":1,"material":1,"divinefocus":1,"slalevel":3,"domain":"Chaos (3)","shortdescription":"As protection spells, but 10-ft. radius and 10 min./level.","chaotic":1,"linktext":"Magic Circle against Law","id":331,"lvlId":17},{"classes":{"cleric":3,"inquisitor":3,"oracle":3,"shaman":3,"occultist":3},"effects":{},"name":"Magic Vestment","school":"transmutation","spelllevel":"cleric/oracle 3, inquisitor 3, shaman 3, occultist 3","castingtime":"1 standard action","components":"V, S, DF","range":"touch","targets":"armor or shield touched","duration":"1 hour/level","savingthrow":"Will negates (harmless, object)","spellresistance":"yes (harmless, object)","description":"You imbue a suit of armor or a shield with an enhancement bonus of +1 per four caster levels (maximum +5 at 20th level).

Lower Water: This causes water or similar liquid to reduce its depth by as much as 2 feet per caster level (to a minimum depth of 1 inch). The water is lowered within a squarish depression whose sides are up to caster level Ãâ 10 feet long. In extremely large and deep bodies of water, such as a deep ocean, the spell creates a whirlpool that sweeps ships and similar craft downward, putting them at risk and rendering them unable to leave by normal movement for the duration of the spell. When cast on water elementals and other water-based creatures, this spell acts as a slow spell (Will negates). The spell has no effect on other creatures. Raise Water: This causes water or similar liquid to rise in height, just as the lower water version causes it to lower. Boats raised in this way slide down the sides of the hump that the spell creates. If the area affected by the spell includes riverbanks, a beach, or other land nearby, the water can spill over onto dry land. With either version of this spell, you may reduce one horizontal dimension by half and double the other horizontal dimension to change the overall area of effect.","source":"PFRPG Core","verbal":1,"somatic":1,"material":1,"divinefocus":1,"slalevel":6,"domain":"Water (4)","shortdescription":"Raises or lowers bodies of water.","linktext":"Control Water","id":97,"bloodline":"Aquatic (11)","patron":"Moon (12), Water (8)","lvlId":1},{"classes":{"cleric":4,"druid":5,"bard":4,"alchemist":4,"witch":5,"inquisitor":4,"oracle":4,"shaman":4,"occultist":4,"spiritualist":4,"hunter":5},"effects":{},"name":"Cure Critical Wounds","school":"conjuration","subschool":"healing","spelllevel":"bard 4, cleric/oracle 4, druid 5, witch 5, inquisitor 4, alchemist 4, shaman 4, occultist 4, spiritualist 4","castingtime":"1 standard action","components":"V, S","range":"touch","targets":"creature touched","duration":"instantaneous","savingthrow":"Will half (harmless); see text","spellresistance":"yes (harmless); see text","description":"This spell functions like cure light wounds, except that it cures 4d8 points of damage + 1 point per caster level (maximum +20).","source":"PFRPG Core","verbal":1,"somatic":1,"adept":4,"slalevel":4,"domain":"Healing (4)","shortdescription":"Cures 4d8 damage + 1/level (max +20).","linktext":"Cure Critical Wounds","id":108,"mythictext":"The damage cured increases to 8d8 points of damage + 2 points per caster level (maximum +40).

If you serve no particular deity, the spell is a general plea answered by a creature sharing your philosophical alignment. If you know an individual creature's name, you may request that individual by speaking the name during the spell (though you might get a different creature anyway).  You may ask the creature to perform one task in exchange for a payment from you. Tasks might range from the simple to the complex. You must be able to communicate with the creature called in order to bargain for its services.  The creature called requires a payment for its services. This payment can take a variety of forms, from donating gold or magic items to an allied temple, to a gift given directly to the creature, to some other action on your part that matches the creature's alignment and goals.  Regardless, this payment must be made before the creature agrees to perform any services. The bargaining takes at least 1 round, so any actions by the creature begin in the round after it arrives.  A task taking up to 1 minute per caster level requires a payment of 100 gp per HD of the creature called. For a task taking up to 1 hour per caster level, the creature requires a payment of 500 gp per HD. A long-term task, one requiring up to 1 day per caster level, requires a payment of 1,000 gp per HD.  A nonhazardous task requires only half the indicated payment, while an especially hazardous task might require a greater gift. Few if any creatures will accept a task that seems suicidal (remember, a called creature actually dies when it is killed, unlike a summoned creature). However, if the task is strongly aligned with the creature's ethos, it may halve or even waive the payment.  At the end of its task, or when the duration bargained for expires, the creature returns to its home plane (after reporting back to you, if appropriate and possible).

If the subject's soul is not willing to return, the spell does not work; therefore, a subject that wants to return receives no saving throw. Since the dead creature is returning in a new body, all physical ills and afflictions are repaired. The condition of the remains is not a factor. So long as some small portion of the creature's body still exists, it can be reincarnated, but the portion receiving the spell must have been part of the creature's body at the time of death. The magic of the spell creates an entirely new young adult body for the soul to inhabit from the natural elements at hand. This process takes 1 hour to complete. When the body is ready, the subject is reincarnated. A reincarnated creature recalls the majority of its former life and form. It retains any class abilities, feats, or skill ranks it formerly possessed. Its class, base attack bonus, base save bonuses, and hit points are unchanged. Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores depend partly on the new body. First eliminate the subject's racial adjustments (since it is no longer necessarily of his previous race) and then apply the adjustments found below to its remaining ability scores. The subject of the spell gains two permanent negative levels when it is reincarnated. If the subject is 1st level, it takes 2 points of Constitution drain instead (if this would reduce its Con to 0 or less, it can't be reincarnated). A character who died with spells prepared has a 50% chance of losing any given spell upon being reincarnated. A spellcreature that doesn't prepare spells (such as a sorcerer) has a 50% chance of losing any given unused spell slot as if it had been used to cast a spell. It's possible for the change in the subject's ability scores to make it difficult for it to pursue its previous character class. If this is the case, the subject is advised to become a multiclass character. For a humanoid creature, the new incarnation is determined using the table on the next page. For nonhumanoid creatures, a similar table of creatures of the same type should be created. A creature that has been turned into an undead creature or killed by a death effect can't be returned to life by this spell. Constructs, elementals, outsiders, and undead creatures can't be reincarnated.

In addition, the target animal is temporarily awakened to sentience (as the awaken spell) for the duration of this spell, and it can use its increased mental acuity to come up with creative solutions to overcome obstacles to delivering its message. The awakened target animal speaks any one language you know. In addition, you can imbue the animal with up to 5 ranks in any of the following skills: Bluff, Diplomacy, Knowledge (local), Knowledge (nobility), Linguistics, or Sense Motive.

It can engage in conversation using its own intellect, knowledge, and linguistic abilities. The animal ambassador is loyal to you, but it is otherwise susceptible to mind-affecting effects like any other creature. You can also send your animal ambassador with an object or container that is within its physical ability to carry, making it deliver the contents to the target of your intended message. If the object it is given to carry is poisonous, trapped, or otherwise inherently dangerous (even if it would normally be dangerous only to the creature receiving it rather than the animal), or if you or your allies attack the target animal, the animal ambassador spell fails and the animal becomes hostile toward you. The animal ambassador intelligently but single-mindedly attempts to deliver the message to its intended target, and you can't task it with other tasks like fighting, scouting, searching for traps, and so on. It leaves on its delivery once it receives its message.

If no common language exists, you can communicate only basic commands, such as \"Come here,\" \"Go there,\" \"Fight,\" and \"Stand still.\" You know what the subject is experiencing, but you do not receive direct sensory input from it, nor can it communicate with you telepathically. Once you have given a dominated creature a command, it continues to attempt to carry out that command to the exclusion of all other activities except those necessary for day-to-day survival (such as sleeping, eating, and so forth). Because of this limited range of activity, a Sense Motive check against DC 15 (rather than DC 25) can determine that the subject's behavior is being influenced by an enchantment effect (see the Sense Motive skill description). Changing your orders or giving a dominated creature a new command is a move action. By concentrating fully on the spell (a standard action), you can receive full sensory input as interpreted by the mind of the subject, though it still can't communicate with you. You can't actually see through the subject's eyes, so it's not as good as being there yourself, but you still get a good idea of what's going on. Subjects resist this control, and any subject forced to take actions against its nature receives a new saving throw with a +2 bonus. Obviously self-destructive orders are not carried out. Once control is established, the range at which it can be exercised is unlimited, as long as you and the subject are on the same plane. You need not see the subject to control it. If you don't spend at least 1 round concentrating on the spell each day, the subject receives a new saving throw to throw off the domination.

Dexterity and dodge bonuses to AC do not count for this calculation.

Unlike with the spell burn spellblight, the burning sensation is a tangible effect, visible during the act of spellcasting as an incorporeal, violet flame surrounding the caster.","source":"Magic Tactics Toolbox","verbal":1,"somatic":1,"slalevel":6,"id":2426,"lvlId":46},{"classes":{"sor":5,"wiz":5,"cleric":5,"druid":5,"bard":6,"witch":6,"oracle":5,"shaman":5,"psychic":6,"hunter":5},"effects":{"mindaffecting":1},"name":"Touch Of Slumber","school":"enchantment","subschool":"compulsion","descriptor":"mind-affecting","spelllevel":"bard 6, cleric/oracle 5, druid 5, psychic 6, shaman 5, sorcerer/wizard 5, witch 6","castingtime":"1 standard action","components":"V, S, M (a bit of seaweed)","range":"touch","targets":"nonhostile creature touched","duration":"instantaneous","savingthrow":"Will negates","spellresistance":"yes","description":"This spell functions only against a creature with an attitude toward you of indifferent or better, and only if the target is not hostile toward you or your visible allies.

Combat Corruption: Each time a creature fails a saving throw to prevent its corruption from progressing (as described in that  corruption's Progression section), it advances to the next corruption stage-at stage 3, it loses the battle against its corruption.

Remove Corruption: You can remove 1 manifestation level from the target creature, as well as the most recently acquired manifestation and its corresponding gift and stain. Doing this also reduces the power of gifts and stains that vary based upon manifestation level. This application of alleviate corruption doesn't reduce the target's corruption stage. If the target creature loses all manifestation levels, it is cured of the corruption.  Either application of the spell requires a caster level check. The DC is equal to 10 + double the target's manifestation level + 3 times the target's corruption stage (effectively 0, 3, or 6, since stage 3 removes the character from player control).  Tampering with corruptions is dangerous, as their nature is contagious. If you fail this caster level check by 5 or more, you contract the corruption and gain a manifestation (the rules for the useful and vile corruption variants still apply). A roll of natural 1 on the caster level check is an automatic failure. If you already have the same corruption, you must instead attempt an immediate saving throw against it.

If the target fails its saving throw, it takes 1d4 points of ability damage to each physical ability score immediately and continues to take 1d4 points of ability damage to each of its physical ability scores every day, until the spell expires. It can't recover this ability damage as long as the spell lasts, even with magic. While the spell continues, the target takes on physical plant characteristics as appropriate to the environment. It begins to diminish in height and its skin turns plantlike. For example, the target's skin might turn green and its hair is slowly replaced with grass or leaves or the target's skin might become smooth, pale, and flabby as the creature transforms into a large mushroom in an underground environment.  If the damage to any single ability score equals or exceeds that score, the target fully transforms into a normal small tree or shrub. This final transformation is instantaneous, ending green caress. The target remains alive but is considered the same as a regular tree, shrub, or other vegetation. Any ability damage from other sources, like poison or disease, also applies toward transforming the creature. If the target retains at least 1 point in all of its physical ability scores at the end of 7 days, the final transformation doesn't occur and the spell ends. Any changes in appearance gradually reverse themselves as the ability damage heals.  Break enchantment, dispel magic, and remove curse can end the spell before the duration expires, but the spell is contagious.

A victim can make a single move or standard action each round while in the haunt's grasp if she succeeds at a Will save; on a failed save, she can only struggle helplessly against the haunt. A victim cannot use her actions to swim toward the surface while the haunt is active. If the haunt reaches the bottom of its body of water, it pounds its victim against the bottom, dealing 2d6 points of nonlethal damage per round to the victim and reducing the  duration the victim can hold her breath by an additional round. This continues until either the haunt is neutralized (in which case the victim must still swim to the surface) or the victim drowns.  The haunt can grab and attempt to drown multiple creatures in its area on its initiative count. The magic holding the haunt together is unstable and deteriorates while the haunt is active. Each round at the end of its turn, the haunt automatically loses 1d6 hit points per creature it is currently affecting. Furthermore, the spell's haunt-like manifestation is active throughout the spell's duration, rendering it vulnerable to effects that damage haunts. When the haunt reaches 0 hit points, the spell ends.","source":"Haunted Heroes Handbook","verbal":1,"somatic":1,"material":1,"divinefocus":1,"slalevel":5,"id":2561,"hauntstatistics":"Notice Perception DC 30 (to detect the smell of brine)  hp 5 hp/level; Trigger proximity; Reset none","lvlId":38},{"classes":{"sor":6,"wiz":6,"cleric":4,"summoner":5,"witch":6,"oracle":4,"shaman":6,"psychic":4,"medium":3,"summonerunchained":5},"effects":{},"name":"Janni's Jaunt","school":"conjuration","subschool":"teleportation","spelllevel":"cleric/oracle 4, medium 3, psychic 4, shaman 6, sorcerer/wizard 6, summoner/unchained summoner 5, witch 6","castingtime":"1 standard action","components":"V, S, F (a forked metal rod attuned to the plane of travel)","range":"touch","targets":"creature touched, or up to eight willing creatures joining hands","duration":"instantaneous","savingthrow":"Will negates","spellresistance":"yes","description":"This spell functions as per plane shift, but with the following exceptions.

Each time the creature is reduced to less than one-tenth of its maximum hit points, the grim stalker lunges at the creature as an immediate action, affecting it as per phantasmal killer.  Each time the grim stalker lunges at the affected creature, the spell's haunt-like manifestation occurs during that round. Alternatively, a haunted creature can attempt to force the grim  stalker to manifest using a simple ritual that requires a successful Knowledge (arcana), Knowledge (religion), or Spellcraft check; occult reagents costing 450 gp (which are consumed as part of the ritual); and a full-round action. The DC for this check equals the spell's save DC. Successfully performing the ritual causes the grim stalker to manifest as a Nessian warhound (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 173) in an available square 20 feet away from the victim, save that its only subtype is extraplanar, its alignment is neutral, its bite and breath weapon deal negative energy damage instead of fire damage, and it has negative energy affinity instead of fire immunity and vulnerability to cold. The grim stalker immediately attacks the affected creature, persisting until either it or the creature is slain, at which point the spell effect (and the warhound) disappears.","source":"Haunted Heroes Handbook","verbal":1,"somatic":1,"material":1,"divinefocus":1,"slalevel":7,"id":2564,"hauntstatistics":"Notice Perception DC 30 (to see a black dog darting toward the target out of the corner of the eye)  hp 4 hp/level; Trigger touch (object); Reset none","lvlId":31},{"classes":{"cleric":7,"druid":7,"inquisitor":6,"oracle":7,"shaman":7},"effects":{"light":1},"name":"Morning Sun","school":"evocation","descriptor":"light","spelllevel":"cleric/oracle 7, druid 7, inquisitor 6, shaman 7","castingtime":"1 standard action","components":"V, S, M (500 gp worth of gold dust)","costlycomponents":1,"range":"close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)","area":"60-ft. radius","duration":"1 minute/level (D)","dismissible":1,"savingthrow":"Fortitude negates and Reflex half, see text","spellresistance":"no","description":"This spell conjures a miniature sphere of sunlight, approximately the size of a human fist, at a desired location within range.

The effect lasts for 1 round, during which time creatures on the ground can't move or attack. A spellcaster on the ground must make a concentration check (DC 20 + spell level) or lose any spell he or she tries to cast. The earthquake affects all terrain, vegetation, structures, and creatures in the area. The specific effect of an earthquake spell depends on the nature of the terrain where it is cast.  Cave, Cavern, or Tunnel: The roof collapses, dealing 8d6 points of damage to any creature caught under the cave-in (Reflex DC 15 half) and pinning that creature beneath the rubble (see below). An earthquake cast on the roof of a very large cavern could also endanger those outside the actual area but below the falling debris and rubble.  Cliffs: Earthquake causes a cliff to crumble, creating a landslide that travels horizontally as far as it falls vertically. Any creature in the path takes 8d6 points of bludgeoning damage (Reflex DC 15 half ) and is pinned beneath the rubble (see below).  Open Ground: Each creature standing in the area must make a DC 15 Reflex save or fall down. Fissures open in the earth, and every creature on the ground has a 25% chance to fall into one (Reflex DC 20 to avoid a fissure). The fissures are 40 feet deep. At the end of the spell, all fissures grind shut. Treat all trapped creatures as if they were in the bury zone of an avalanche, trapped without air (see Chapter 13 for more details).  Structure: Any structure standing on open ground takes 100 points of damage, enough to collapse a typical wooden or masonry building, but not a structure built of stone or reinforced masonry.  Hardness does not reduce this damage, nor is it halved as damage dealt to objects normally is. Any creature caught inside a collapsing structure takes 8d6 points of bludgeoning damage (Reflex DC 15 half ) and is pinned beneath the rubble (see below).  River, Lake, or Marsh: Fissures open under the water, draining away the water from that area and forming muddy ground. Soggy marsh or swampland becomes quicksand for the duration of the spell, sucking down creatures and structures. Each creature in the area must make a DC 15 Reflex save or sink down in the mud and quicksand. At the end of the spell, the rest of the body of water rushes in to replace the drained water, possibly drowning those caught in the mud.  Pinned Beneath Rubble: Any creature pinned beneath rubble takes 1d6 points of nonlethal damage per minute while pinned. If a pinned character falls unconscious, he or she must make a DC 15 Constitution check or take 1d6 points of lethal damage each minute thereafter until freed or dead.","source":"PFRPG Core","verbal":1,"somatic":1,"divinefocus":1,"slalevel":8,"domain":"Destruction (8), Earth (8), Ruins (8)","shortdescription":"Intense tremor shakes 80-ft. radius.","linktext":"Earthquake","id":173,"bloodline":"Deep Earth (17), Div (17)","mythictext":"Increase the damage dealt to structures by 10 points of damage per tier.

These winds grant you a fly speed of 60 feet with perfect maneuverability. Neither your armor nor your load affects this fly speed. The winds shield you from any other wind effects, and form a shell of breathable air around you, allowing you to fly and breathe underwater or in outer space. Ranged weapons (including giant-thrown boulders, siege weapon projectiles, and other massive ranged weapons) passing through the winds are deflected by the winds and automatically miss you. Gases and most gaseous breath weapons cannot pass though the winds. In addition, when a creature hits you with a melee attack, you can shape your winds so they lash out at that creature as an immediate action. The creature must make a Fortitude saving throw or take 5d8 points of bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone (if on the ground). On a failed save, Huge flying creatures are checked and Large-sized or smaller flying creatures are blown away instead of knocked prone (see page 439 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook for more information).

This spell must be cast on the plane to which the petitioner was sent, and the petitioner must be present for the entire casting. In addition, the caster must provide a specific object that the petitioner valued deeply in its mortal life as a focus for the spell. This is different for every petitioner and usually requires research to discover, although those who knew the petitioner well in life can often identify the item easily. At the completion of the spell's casting, the petitioner returns to the mortal form it had as a young adult, with all of its memories and class levels (or equivalent statistics) intact.  The casting of judgment undone is not without risk. The servants of Pharasma vigilantly watch for perversions of the order of fate and death, though it can take time for them to pinpoint disruptions when they occur. After 1d6+5 minutes from the beginning of this spell's 10-minute casting time, an olethrosB6 appears within 50 feet of the caster; this psychopomp demands the caster cease casting the spell immediately and attacks if its request is ignored. The psychopomp never attempts to harm the petitioner unless judgment undone has already been successfully cast by the time the psychopomp arrives, in which case it attempts to eliminate the returned mortal as well. If the caster and returned mortal are no longer present, the olethros does what she can to track both down and exact judgment-how successful she may be depends on the GM's discretion.  The caster of judgment undone can pause the spell's casting for up to 1 minute without causing the spell to fail. During this time, the caster does not need to concentrate on judgment undone and can act normally and cast other spells without disrupting the spell, but if she does not begin casting again before this 1-minute window elapses, the spell fails.  It is possible to cast judgment undone without incurring the wrath of a psychopomp, but doing so requires the caster to first visit the Boneyard and seek out a powerful agent of Pharasma to gain permission to restore the petitioner to its mortal life. The details and difficulty of this task are subject to the GM's discretion, but at the very least should involve a significant expenditure of time and resources. The granting of permission to cast judgment undone is an excellent reward for a quest given to a party of adventurers from a powerful psychopomp. If the PCs exceed expectations in fulfilling this quest, it's not unheard of for the psychopomp to not only grant permission for the spell's casting, but to also provide the diamonds needed for the spell's material component, information about the required focus, or even both. Worshipers of Pharasma who cast this spell without securing permission in this manner are considered to have grossly violated Pharasma's code of conduct.","source":"Planar Adventures","verbal":1,"somatic":1,"material":1,"slalevel":9,"shortdescription":"Restores a petitioner to its mortal life.","id":2875,"materialcosts":50000,"lvlId":18}]]
