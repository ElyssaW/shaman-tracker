# Shaman Tracker

This is an app to help you keep track of your Pathfinder 1E Shaman characters. You can create a new Shaman, or if you've made Shamans before, load in a previous character. Keep track of basic stats, spirits, wandering spirits, hexes, and spells, and change your loadout easily to take advantage of the Shaman's in-built flexibility, without getting bogged down by bookwork.
